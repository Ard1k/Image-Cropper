# Image Cropper Tool
**An application for cropping images in half and saving both sides.**

* It can crop all images in the same directory where the .exe file is executed or crop the images dropped onto the .exe file.
* It will only crop images if their width is equal to or larger than 3840 pixels (or the width specified in the `minImageWidth` variable).
* It will only crop images if their extension is *.jpg or *.png (or the extensions specified in the `fileExtensionsList` list).
* The resulting images will be saved in the same directory as the original image, with the same name followed by `_1.png` for the left side and `_2.png` for the right side.
